# Sentiment-Analysis


This repo is the implementation of research papers on Sentiment Analysis using Machine Learning, published by Bo Pand and Lee. The results presented in the paper were replicated by following all the nitty gritties mentioned in the paper. The two research papers, implemented in this repo are :

   1)Sentiment Analysis using machine Learning ( find it as "W02-1011.pdf" in this repo )
   2)Sentiment Analysis Using Subjectivity Summarization Based on Minimum Cuts ( find it as "acl04_cutsent.pdf" in this repo )

The main objective is to classify the text written reviews into either positive/ negative, by gettng insights from training data, fed to a machine learning model. Further improvements in the classification accuracies are achieved by removing useless sentences and retaining only subjective sentences in the review data. This thought process and procedure was mentioned in the sencond paper.

Final results and conclusions of this repository is to replicate the accuracies provided in the paper. Please pull request to fix any issue if found!
